Arduino project with Highscore connected to the EEPROM

The LED's and buttons are connected to the following pins;
redLed = 2;
yellowLed = 3;
greenLed = 4;
blueLed = 5;
redButton = 6;
yellowButton = 7;
greenButton = 8;
blueButton = 9;

At the moment you can see the highscore and your current score in the console. If you want to you can connect it to a display instead. Code for that will come later.
